## Hash Table Practice Exercises 

<pre> 
1. What is a hash table? Explain how they work (hash function and buckets).
</pre> 

</br> 

<pre>
2. Explain how hashtables work internally. How is hashcode generated and what will happen
to the hash code when 2 values are same.
</pre> 

</br>

3. How do you implement a HashTable? What data structures are used internally to implement 
this HashTable?
</pre> 

</br>

4. What is load factor? 
</pre> 

</br> 

<pre> 
5. What is a collision and how can it be resolved? 
</pre>

7. Find the Kth most Frequent Number in an Array.
 
 Example:
 
 let arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
 k = 2
 Result: 3
 
 Because '3' is the second most occurring element.
